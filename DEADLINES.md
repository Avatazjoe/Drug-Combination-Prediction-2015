# Challenge deadlines and format
There can be 3 submissions per round except for the Final Round.

## Subchallenge 1
There are three rounds plus the Final Round.

The submission format for 1A and 1B is the same: one zip file containing two csv files named prediction.csv, and combination_priority.csv.

For prediction.svn: three columns are CELL_LINE (normalized cell line name), COMBINATION_ID (two drug names separated by a dot) and PREDICTION (prediction value).

For combination_priority.csv: two columns are COMBINATION_ID (two drug names separated by a dot, the same as above) and CONFIDENCE (a decimal representation ranging from 0 to 1, the higher the more confident in the prediction regarding this combination).
