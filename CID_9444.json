Several reagents including differentiation-inducing and antineoplastic agents are known to inhibit telomerase activity, although the molecular mechanisms through which they inhibit telomerase activity remain unclear. Demethylating reagents have recently been used as potential antineoplastic drugs for some types of cancers including those of the prostate. In the present study, we examined the effect of the demethylating reagent <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-9444\" href=\"/compound/5-azacytidine\">5-azacytidine</a> (<a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-9444\" href=\"/compound/5-aza-CR\">5-aza-CR</a>) on telomerase activity using cells of two prostate cancer cell lines, DU-145 and TSU-PR1. <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-9444\" href=\"/compound/5-aza-CR\">5-aza-CR</a> treatment significantly reduced telomerase activity in TSU-PR1 cells, but not in DU-145 cells, although growth inhibition was observed to a similar extent in both cell lines. Reverse transcription-PCR analyses revealed that inhibition of telomerase activity was accompanied by down-regulation of telomerase catalytic subunit (hTERT) mRNA expression. Transient expression assays showed that <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-9444\" href=\"/compound/5-aza-CR\">5-aza-CR</a> repressed the transcriptional activity of the hTERT promoter and that the E-box within the core promoter was responsible for this down-regulation. Western blot analyses revealed that <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-9444\" href=\"/compound/5-aza-CR\">5-aza-CR</a> reactivated p16 expression and repressed c-Myc expression in TSU-PR1 cells but not in DU-145 cells. Overexpression of p16 in TSU-PR1 cells led to significant repression of c-Myc transcription. These findings suggest that <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-9444\" href=\"/compound/5-aza-CR\">5-aza-CR</a> inhibits telomerase activity via transcriptional repression of hTERT, in which p16 and c-Myc may play a key role."

Human bone marrow fibroblasts and MG63 cells treated with <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-9444\" href=\"/compound/5azaC\">5azaC</a> were used as models of osteogenic progenitors and of a more mature osteoblast phenotype, respectively. The capacity for differentiation of these cells following treatment with glucocorticoids was investigated. <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-9444\" href=\"/compound/5azaC\">5azaC</a> treatment led to significant expression of the osteoblastic marker alkaline phosphatase in MG63 osteosarcoma cells, which was further augmented by glucocorticoids; however, in human marrow fibroblasts alkaline phosphatase activity was only observed in glucocorticoid-treated cultures. MG63 cells represent a phenotype late in the osteogenic lineage in which demethylation is sufficient to induce alkaline phosphatase activity. Marrow fibroblasts are at an earlier stage of differentiation and require stimulation with glucocorticoids. In contrast, the expression of osteocalcin, an osteoblastic marker, was unaffected by <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-9444\" href=\"/compound/5azaC\">5azaC</a> treatment, suggesting that regulation of expression of the osteocalcin gene does not involve methylation.

Testicular tissues from all groups were taken 20 days after birth and examined at the light and electron microscopical levels. All pregnancies were terminated in Group 1 animals, therefore no observations could be done in this group. While Group 2 and 3 siblings showed distinctive kongenital abnormalities such as; anancephaly, growth failure, cleft palate, extremity abnormalities, supernumerary ribs and whirled shaped-tails, no such abnormalities were observed in Group 4 when compared to the control group. Microscopical examination of testicular tissues in groups 2 and 3 demonstrated cellular disintegration of spermatocytes in seminiferous tubules. In addition, cytoplasmic vacuoles and thickening of the basement membrane were also evident in both groups 2 and 3. Apoptotic-like cells were seen especially in group 2 and rarely in group 3. There were no structural alterations in group 4 animals, except a decreased number of spermatocytes in seminiferous tubules when compared to the control group, possibly indicating the completion of embryogenesis in this group. In conclusion, it could be suggested that the demethylating agent <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-9444\" href=\"/compound/5-azacytidine\">5-azacytidine</a> may trigger an unknown gene reactivation during early embryogenesis possibly affecting the cell and tissue differentiation in developing mammalian embryos."

In this study, the mutagenic potential of this drug was tested in the G10 and G12 transgenic Chinese hamster cell lines, which have a single bacterial gpt gene integrated into the genome at different sites, with its expression driven by a simian virus 40 (SV40) promoter. We show that the mutation frequencies following a 48-h exposure to different concentrations of <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-9444\" href=\"/compound/5-AzaC\">5-AzaC</a> were 10 to 20 times higher than those of any of the other numerous mutagens that have been tested in the G10-G12 system. Moreover, the mutation frequencies were much higher in the G10 cell line than in the G12 cells. Detailed molecular analysis of the <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-2723601\" href=\"/compound/6-thioguanine\">6-thioguanine</a> (<a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-2723601\" href=\"/compound/6-TG\">6-TG</a>)-resistant variants demonstrated that transgene silencing by de novo DNA methylation and increased chromatin condensation in the SV40 promoter was the major factor responsible for this high level of <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-2723601\" href=\"/compound/6-TG\">6-TG</a> resistance. As would be expected, exposure to <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-9444\" href=\"/compound/5-AzaC\">5-AzaC</a> lowered the overall genomic DNA methylation levels, but it unexpectedly caused hypermethylation and increased chromatin condensation of the transgene in both the G10 and G12 cell lines. These results provide the first evidence that <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-9444\" href=\"/compound/5-AzaC\">5-AzaC</a> may also induce transgene-specific DNA methylation, a phenomenon that can further be used for the elucidation of the mechanism that controls silencing of foreign DNA."

We engineered the U937 human cell line with a retroviral vector consisting of the <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-5789\" href=\"/compound/thymidine\">thymidine</a> kinase suicide gene (tk), which induces sensitivity to <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-3454\" href=\"/compound/ganciclovir\">ganciclovir</a> (gcv) and through an IRES sequence, the bacterial beta-galactosidase gene (lacZ) as a marker gene. About 90% of the U937 cells expressed the transgene. By injecting the transduced U937 cells in severe combined immunodeficient disease (SCID) mice, we generated a tumor which, during in vivo treatment with aza-C, maintained the high expression of lacZ and tk genes at the baseline values. LacZ-positive cells in the tumour masses after death was weak (1-2%) in the control group, while in mice treated with aza-C it was maintained at 90%. The delay in tumour onset was significantly longer when animals were treated with both aza-C and gcv (P &lt; 0.0001) compared with animals treated with gcv or with aza-C alone. The prevention of silencing phenomena has important implications for gene therapy, because an efficient transduction associated with appropriate drug therapy, might be a powerful strategy for successful application of gene therapy protocols."

At a final concentration of 1 microM Aza had no effects, whereas higher concentrations stopped development of all stages except the zygote. In contrast Eth treatments (5 mM) resulted in a severe reduction of the mean cell number per embryo in comparison with controls. Moreover both the absence of blastocyst formation and no effects on mitotic activity were detected. The most prominent effect of Eth was detected at the zygote and 4-cell stages.

Heat shock (1 hr at 43 degrees C) or <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-9444\" href=\"/compound/5-azacytidine\">5-azacytidine</a> markedly inhibited the release of NO into the medium from interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) plus <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-11970143\" href=\"/compound/lipopolysaccharide\">lipopolysaccharide</a> (LPS)-stimulated macrophages.

When heat-shocked cells were stimulated with IFN-gamma plus LPS under normal culture conditions at 37 degrees C, the heat shock-induced inhibition of NO release reversed progressively with increasing recovery time. Although the total amount of cellular HSP72 measured by Western blot increased time-dependently over 7 hr, newly synthesized HSP72 measured by [35S]methionine incorporation was evident only after 1 and 3 hr of recovery time after heat shock treatment. At these time points, the lowest <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-946\" href=\"/compound/nitrite\">nitrite</a> accumulation and TNF-alpha secretion into the medium was evident.

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.
